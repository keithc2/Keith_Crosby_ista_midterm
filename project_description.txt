This is problem B on the Midterm for ISTA 401. In short this project is creating a 20X20 Tic-Tac-Toe game against the computer. The difference is though, that the computer can play after a certain time frame which changes every time it plays. In other words the first move it plays may be 5 seconds apart from the second but the third move, completely independent of your moves, will be 95% of the previous time.

  The Program will then check to see if there is a winner, 5 in-a-row.

a.) There is a 20X20 grid on a screen and a computer.
Click to make your move.

b.) This was a simple piece, just some basic for loops using the java library and using a built in mouse tracker.

c.) Simplicity. My artistic view of this piece is to make the game the highlight. Do you have the patience to see if you can win against the computer?
